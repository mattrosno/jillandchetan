					<div class="title l-center">Jill + Chetan</div>
					<p>Jill and Chetan started dating their first year of medical school at Dartmouth. They both spent a great deal of time running (when perhaps they should have been studying) and enjoying the beautiful Upper Valley countryside. Once Chetan finally decided he was ready to ask Jill out, their dear friend Richard Cheng almost tried to thwart his plans (apparently he was afraid Chetan would get shot down). Luckily, Chetan didn't listen to his advice and asked Jill to join him on a walk around Occum Pond. This eventually lead to the Couple's Match where they landed two residency spots at Northwestern. They are currently finishing up their last year of residency and loving the vibrant city of Chicago!</p>

					<div class="title l-center">Proposal</div>
					<p>Chetan schemed the proposal idea over Chicago deep dish pizza the spring of 2012 with their friends Andy and Ami. A trip to Nantucket was already planned for that fall, and Andy took the responsibility of transporting the ring to the Island. The ring almost disappeared after a travel bag was momentarily forgotten in the taxi, but it somehow safely made it to Chetan's pocket the night of August 14th on Madaket Beach. After walking down the beach with a perfect sunset in the background, he asked Jill to sit down and close her eyes. She expected to receive a trinket from the island, and was overjoyed when instead a diamond ring fell into her hands!</p>

				<div class="party-title">Maid of Honor</div>
				<p>I went through high school and college as Jill Marie<sup>2</sup>, sharing not only a first name but also a middle name with my best friend Jill LaGrange.  We started off as running buddies at Southeast High School and then became roommates at UNL (where she tolerated all my quirks and encouraged my dreams).  I am thrilled that we live a bit closer again, as she is a medical resident at the University of Madison-Wisconsin.</p>

				<p>Jackie and I met our freshman year at UNL through Chi Omega, and having lived hundreds of miles apart for six years we have accumulated hundreds of hours of phone time.  Everyone needs a friend with her spunky personality, contagious laugh and listening ear. She flew to NE last fall to help me plan this wedding and find a gown.   Jackie and her husband Curtis now live in Fort Collins, Colorado.</p>

				<p>Kate is everything a woman ought to be - an amazing baker, musician, runner and friend.  I had the luck of living with her during our last three years of medical school, where I would wake up to the aroma of her homemade cobbler and fall asleep with a stomach full of her chocolate chip cookies. She is a medical resident in Ontario, and is planning a wedding with her fianc&#xe9; Dan in 2014.</p>

				<p>Alissa is also an amazing catch from Dartmouth.  We instantly became running, cross-country skiing and study buddies.  Her energy and upbeat attitude are parallel to none - exemplified by her recent trip to downtown Chicago with her beautiful four month old daughter Eliana and husband Mark. She is a pediatric resident at the University of Washington, where she recently matched to pursue a fellowship in endocrinology!</p>

She has now blossomed into a beautiful, caring and charismatic woman just like her mother Kris. She will be starting her freshman year at the University of Nebraska-Kearney this fall.</p>

				<p class="party-desc">My brother Vivek is the most outgoing, fun-loving, and adventurous of the three of us. Some of my favorite memories are of Vivek and I skiing with my dad when we were kids. Vivek would refuse to make any turns, instead skiing straight down the mountain at full speed stopping only when he would inevitably wipe out in dramatic fashion. Vivek graduated from Skidmore College in 2010 and is now living in Atlanta with my brother Gautam, looking for a new adventure.</p>

				<p class="party-desc">I spent the majority of my childhood trying to be like my older brother, Gautam. I followed his lead in sports, music, and basically everything. He was the trailblazer for Vivek and I as we followed in his footsteps. Gautam finished law school at Northwestern the year before Jill and I moved to Chicago, and now he lives in Atlanta where he works for a law firm. He is the only member of the Huded family to truly embrace country music.</p>

We spent many family vacations together, and all five of us worked together at Sunrise Resort one memorable summer. Adith graduated from law school at Georgetown and now lives in New York City where he frequently hosts Jill and I when we visit.</p>

				<p class="party-desc">Richard and I were assigned as roommates by chance as first years at Dartmouth, and we commonly joke that we only ended up being friends because no one else would hang out with us. Richard introduced me to the secret menu at our favorite restaurant in New Hampshire, a chinese restaurant inside of a gas station (I swear it's delicious), and I introduced Richard to running. After only two years he qualified for the Boston Marathon and we both ran Boston together in the spring of our last year at Dartmouth. Richard lives in Los Angeles where he is doing his medical residency at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</p>

				<p class="party-desc">These two brothers are representing our family in Vermont. Patty and Brian Trottier (their grandparents) asked Tricia and Jill over for coffee soon after moving to NH once they heard wind of my Nebraska roots. Little did they know that their invite would lead to regular dinners with the entire family, "sugaring" expeditions, white coat ceremonies, easter egg hunts and trips to Chicago. I'm not sure if the boys are more excited about flying or the actual wedding, but we are thrilled they can help us celebrate!</p>
